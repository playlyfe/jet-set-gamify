==============

This repo serves as the technical half of the tutorial series **[Jet-Set-Gamify](https://blog.playlyfe.com/jet-set-gamify-making-a-gamified-todo-app)**

> The Jet-Set-Gamify tutorial series focusses on helping you create a kick-ass Gamified app from scratch using the Playlyfe Platform.

Hello there! Are you looking to use **[Gamification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification "Read more on Wikipedia")** in one of your apps? We can help you with that! Wanna to see how? This series will show you how!

In this tutorial series, we'll take a look at how we can gamify an existing web-app using Playlyfe without writing much code. Your application could be anything — a website, a mobile fitness tracker, traffic speed guns — but for simplicity, we will only be creating a simple, but gamified, todo application.

If you are new to the Playlyfe platform, We would highly recommend that you have a look at our [Getting Started](https://dev.playlyfe.com/guides/getting-started.html "A guide of great proportions awaits you!") guide which will give you a quick overview of the platform and its components. Don't worry if you don't understand some things, we will try to cover all the basics in this tutorial.

### Running
This app requires you to start a web-server. Any webserver would do, but for simplicity's sake, we'll be working with [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Clone this repo onto your local computer with:

```
git clone https://github.com/playlyfe/jet-set-gamify.git
